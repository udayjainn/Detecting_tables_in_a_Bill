# Detecting_tables_in_a_Bill
Given an bill / invoice, the goal of this project is to train an image detection model, which can detect table structure in given document.

# Dataset Used-PubTabNet
PubTabNet is a large dataset for image-based table recognition, containing 568k+ images of tabular data annotated with the corresponding HTML representation of the tables. The table images are extracted from the scientific publications included in the PubMed Central Open Access Subset (commercial use collection). Table regions are identified by matching the PDF format and the XML format of the articles in the PubMed Central Open Access Subset. More details are available in our paper "Image-based table recognition: data, model, and evaluation".
